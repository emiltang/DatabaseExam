AB -> C is a functional depency, if the realtion were to be in BCNF, AB should 
be a superkey. Since AB only determines C, it is not a superkey. This is a 
violation of BCNF.

CD -> A is also a violation of BCNF. R can the be slit up into two relations, 
BCDE and CDA.

E -> D is a violation in BCDE, it can then be split into ED and BCE.

Finally there are three relations BCE, CDA, and ED. Wich are all in BCNF.
