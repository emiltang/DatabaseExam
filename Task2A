Since no functional depencencies determine B and E, they must be part of a key.
This will rule out all possible keys that does not contain these two

BE -> D 

Be is not key since it only determins D.

ABE -> CD key!
BCE -> AD key!
BDE -> n/a

If BE is combined with one of the three other tuples, then ABE determines CD.
This determines all tuples and is a key. BCE is also a kay.
BDE is not a key,

ABCE -> D superkey!
ABDE -> C superkey!
BCDE -> A superkey!

With four tubles, all possible keys that include both B and E, are supersets of 
the keys from above. They are then superkeys.
